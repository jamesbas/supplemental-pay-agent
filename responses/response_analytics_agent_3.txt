The breakdown of supplemental pay hours by wage type reveals various patterns across categories. For instance:

- **Call Out 1.5**: This category shows relatively high activity with a steady decrease from September (2684 hours) to December (205.40 hours).
- **Call Out 1.2 X HrRt**: Several categories, like this one, also experience a decline, aligning with general trends.
- **Standby categories**: Some categories (e.g., "Standby Â£70") show sharp reductions across months, indicating potential changes in Standby hours or shifts.

To better visualize these trends and identify major contributors, I propose plotting the top wage types (by total hours) across the months. Shall I proceed with creating these visualizations?
