The histograms provide further insights into the distribution of hours worked:

1. **September 2024**:
   - The majority of employees worked between 25 to 75 hours.
   - A fairly symmetrical distribution with moderate variability.

2. **October 2024**:
   - Hours worked are skewed heavily toward lower values (less than 10 hours), indicating a significant reduction in activity.
   - Few extreme outliers are visible above 100 hours.

3. **November 2024**:
   - Similar skewed distribution to October, but with a wider variability.
   - Visible anomalies (e.g., hours worked exceeding 500) and potential negative values require data validation.

### Observations:
- A sharp decline in hours worked post-September indicates potential seasonal or operational changes.
- Extreme outliers in October and November necessitate further investigation and potential correction.
