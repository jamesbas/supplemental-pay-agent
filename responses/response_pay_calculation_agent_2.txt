To calculate the supplemental pay for overtime work for employee 10000518, I need the following information:

1. The employee's base hourly pay rate.
2. The number of overtime hours worked.
3. Any specific overtime policy that applies, such as rates different from the standard of 1.5x base pay.
4. Applicable tax rates for withholding.

Please provide the necessary details, or let me know if these details are included in the uploaded files, so I can extract them accordingly and perform the calculation.
