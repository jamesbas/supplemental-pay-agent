The reconstructed worksheet data links cell references to their corresponding human-readable text. The table structure includes key headers such as:

- **Employee Identification** (e.g., "Emp ID", "Name of employee or applicant")
- **Company Information** (e.g., "Company Code", "Company Name")
- **Wage Types and Hours** (e.g., "Wage Type", "Hours Sep 2024", "Hours Oct 2024")

This dataset is relevant for understanding supplemental pay policies and calculating pay based on hours worked and wage types. To address your payment issue:

1. Could you specify the exact nature of the issueâ€”whether it's related to eligibility, calculation misalignment, or approval workflows?
2. I will extract more specific policy data tied to wage types and approval processes if needed.
