# DXC Supplemental Pay AI Agent System Architecture

## System Overview

The DXC Supplemental Pay AI Agent System is designed to help HR personnel, people managers, and payroll managers analyze supplemental pay data, identify trends and outliers, and make actionable recommendations based on DXC policies. The system leverages Azure AI Agent Service to process policy documents and Excel files from a local data directory and provide intelligent insights.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Technologies
- **Azure AI Agent Service**: For creating and managing AI agents with specific capabilities
- **Azure AI Foundry SDK**: For building and managing AI models and workflows
- **GPT-4o**: As the core large language model
- **Python**: As the primary development language

### 2. System Modules

#### Data Access Layer
- Local file connector for document retrieval
- Excel data processor for parsing supplemental pay data
- Data transformation services for agent consumption

#### Agent Core
- **Policy Extraction Agent**: Processes policy documents to extract rules and guidelines
- **Pay Calculation Agent**: Analyzes employee data and applies policy rules
- **Analytics Agent**: Identifies trends, outliers, and opportunities for improvement

#### Tools Layer
- Code interpreter for data analysis
- Document processor for text extraction
- Custom tools for specialized calculations

## Data Flow

1. User initiates a request through the Azure AI Agent Service
2. Request is processed by the appropriate agent(s)
3. Agents access local data through the Data Access Layer
4. Excel files are processed using code interpreter tool
5. Agents analyze data based on extracted policies
6. Results are returned to the user with recommendations

## Agent Capabilities

### Policy Extraction Agent
- Access and process policy documents
- Extract relevant pay policies
- Structure policy data for reasoning
- Validate employee/organization eligibility

### Pay Calculation Agent
- Process employee data from Excel files
- Apply policy rules extracted by Policy Extraction Agent
- Calculate appropriate supplemental pay
- Generate approval recommendations

### Analytics Agent
- Identify trends in supplemental pay data
- Flag outliers and discrepancies
- Track client billable vs. internally absorbed costs
- Generate insights for process improvement

## Security Considerations
- All data is processed securely and not stored unnecessarily
- All recommendations are traceable to source policies
- Access control through Azure AI Agent Service authentication

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up development environment with Azure AI SDK dependencies
2. Configure Azure AI Agent Service project and agents
3. Develop local file connector for data access
4. Create agent capabilities using Azure AI Agent Service SDK
5. Integrate code interpreter tool for Excel analysis
6. Implement agent orchestration logic
7. Test with sample scenarios from each user story
8. Refine agent responses based on feedback
